Submission for HackTX 2021. (Backend) - AlcoWatch is a seamless mobile solution to an age old problem. The app itself allows you to set a time for when you can test if you are drunk. Then, if you don't pass one of the provided tests (memory or balance), AlcoWatch will call/text your primary and secondary contacts with a warning message, as well as a real-time display of your location. This will ensure your own safety as well as the safety of others around you.
